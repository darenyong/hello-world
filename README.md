This is a tutorial setting up webstorm and git on my pc.

# notes

Waterline 0.13.1 uses sails-disk@beta and sails-mongo@beta

use npm install sails-disk@beta to avoid errors with registerDatastore not found.

For waterline beta docs, refer to Sails v1.0 beta [docs](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/tree/1.0)
